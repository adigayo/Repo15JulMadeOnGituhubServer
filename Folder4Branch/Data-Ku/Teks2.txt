Error Message "fatal remote origin already exists"
-------- Solution --------------------------------------
You are getting this error because "origin" is not available. "origin" is a convention not part of the command. "origin" is the local name of the remote repository.

For example you could also write:

git remote add myorigin git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git  
git remote add testtest git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git

See the manual:

http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html

To remove a remote repository you enter:

git remote rm origin

Again "origin" is the name of the remote repository if you want to remove the "experimental" branch on the remote.

git remote rm experimental

"git remote rm origin" didn't work from me, if it doesn't work for you try to check with "git remote -v" this will show you if your origin has a url set, if it doesn't likely you did the init locally and are trying to push it remote, and made a misstep like me). Then follow RobinH's answer: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/projectname.git –  Clarence Liu May 23 at 1:46

check this answer in order to force the url. –  srodriguex Jun 5 at 21:32
